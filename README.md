# designed-Robotic-LegJoints

i tried at this project to design a robotic leg with joints that reperesent hips , knee and ankle .

## Step by step Guide :
first , I've use OnShape design this project 
using many planes to design each leg 
<br>
- plane at knee and hip .<br>
- plane at the middle of the leg to have a symmetric .<br>

  ## Movement
  I've tried to improve movement by create joints to make it more Human-Mimicking Robot
